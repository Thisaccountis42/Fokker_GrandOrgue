Unofficial Fokker Organ Emulator for GrandOrgue
Version date: 2022-04-28

This sampleset is heavily based on Ere Lievonen's Fokker Emulator (version 0.4), 
which is a Custom Organ Definition file for Hauptwerk that enables the Hauptwerk Virtual Organ
software to emulate the microtonal (31 tones / octave) Fokker organ, situated in the Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ in
Amsterdam. His emulator fan be found at http://www.erelievonen.eu/documents/ .

This sampleset was created with Vincent Forman's Organ Builder version 1.0.2.0 
(https://virtualpipeorgans.wordpress.com/tools/organ-builder-by-vincent-forman/).
(I also uploaded this software to archive.org for long term preservation: https://archive.org/details/organ-builder-portable-1.0.2.0)

These samples do not sound identical to the samples in the Fokker Emulator 
or the sounds of the Fokker organ itself, but they sound similar enough to give a good idea of 
the Fokker Organ's sound.

This sampleset is created for GrandOrgue and has been tested on releases v3.5.0-1 and v3.6.5-1,
